Kudos to Dave Gandy who has created an incredible cool icon font called [Font Awesome][1].

This font fits perfectly into JavaFX as

* all these beautiful icons are scalable vector graphics
* each icon (unicode character) can be styled with css
* incredible lightweight (one font 369 icons)

This project provides a helper class (AwesomeDude) for easy usage of these icons in JavaFX apps.

Currently FontAwesome 4.0.1 is supported.
